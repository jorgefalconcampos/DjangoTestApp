# **Django Test App** 
**REQUIRES**: Python >= 3.6.6, Django >= 3.0.7 and other packages specified in 'reqs.txt'


## What is this repo for:

  1) This repo contains some of the better practices and tutorials for uploading a simple Django Application to 
  Amazon AWS.

  2) This is for personal use, but I've decided to open source it in order to help those Django beginners, just like me.

  3) Many resources, tutorials and videos were watched to create this, main resources are:

    *
    * https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Deployment
    * https://swapps.com/es/blog/almacene-assets-estaticos-de-django-con-amazon-s3/

**NOTE**: At the moment of creating my personal Amazon AWS account, I've created it with an [Amazon AWS Educate Account](https://www.awseducate.com/Registration#APP_TYPE). This could have consecuences in some configuration settings.
